Your friendly productivity companion living in the browser's bottom border

#The idea

Adorable Kitten Avatar: A playful kitten lives along your browser's bottom edge
Customizable Timers: Set your own work/break durations (default: 25/5 minutes)
Smart Notifications: Gentle visual/audio reminders when it's break time
Pause Anytime: Start/stop from the toolbar icon or kitten interactions
Persistent Settings: Your preferences survive browser restarts
Zero Distractions: Non-intrusive design that never covers content
Cross-Platform: Working on Brave (for now as I use brave mainly)
